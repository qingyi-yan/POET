/* These are defined by the user (or the compiler)
   to specify the desired environment:

   __STRICT_ANSI__	ISO Standard C.
   _ISOC99_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C89 from ISO C99.
   _ISOC11_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C11.
   __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT2__
			Extensions to ISO C99 from TR 27431-2:2010.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-1:2014.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_FUNCS_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-4:2015.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-3:2015.

   _POSIX_SOURCE	IEEE Std 1003.1.
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE	If ==1, like _POSIX_SOURCE; if >=2 add IEEE Std 1003.2;
			if >=199309L, add IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993;
			if >=199506L, add IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995;
			if >=200112L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2004
			if >=200809L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2008
   _XOPEN_SOURCE	Includes POSIX and XPG things.  Set to 500 if
			Single Unix conformance is wanted, to 600 for the
			sixth revision, to 700 for the seventh revision.
   _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED XPG things and X/Open Unix extensions.
   _LARGEFILE_SOURCE	Some more functions for correct standard I/O.
   _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE	Additional functionality from LFS for large files.
   _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=N	Select default filesystem interface.
   _ATFILE_SOURCE	Additional *at interfaces.
   _GNU_SOURCE		All of the above, plus GNU extensions.
   _DEFAULT_SOURCE	The default set of features (taking precedence over
			__STRICT_ANSI__).

   _FORTIFY_SOURCE	Add security hardening to many library functions.
			Set to 1 or 2; 2 performs stricter checks than 1.

   _REENTRANT, _THREAD_SAFE
			Obsolete; equivalent to _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance
   options such as `-std=c99', define __STRICT_ANSI__.  If none of
   these are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined, the default is
   to have _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
   200809L, as well as enabling miscellaneous functions from BSD and
   SVID.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.  For
   example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together
   give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __GLIBC_USE (F)	Define things from feature set F.  This is defined
			to 1 or 0; the subsequent macros are either defined
			or undefined, and those tests should be moved to
			__GLIBC_USE.
   __USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_ISOCXX11	Define ISO C++11 things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_MISC		Define things from 4.3BSD or System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.

   The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
   only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
   to test for features.

   All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
   explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.
   Feature-test macros that are not defined by the user or compiler
   but are implied by the other feature-test macros defined (or by the
   lack of any definitions) are defined by the file.

   ISO C feature test macros depend on the definition of the macro
   when an affected header is included, not when the first system
   header is included, and so they are handled in
   <bits/libc-header-start.h>, which does not have a multiple include
   guard.  Feature test macros that can be handled from the first
   system header included are handled here.  */

   is defined, use POSIX.1-2008 (or another version depending on
   _XOPEN_SOURCE).  */


/* Some C libraries once required _REENTRANT and/or _THREAD_SAFE to be

/* The machine-dependent file <bits/typesizes.h> defines __*_T_TYPE
   macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
   of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, always long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  */

   are not defined, give the right value and type as long as both int
   and wchar_t are 32-bit types.  Adding L'\0' to a constant value
   ensures that the type is correct; it is necessary to use (L'\0' +
   0) rather than just L'\0' so that the type in C++ is the promoted
   version of wchar_t rather than the distinct wchar_t type itself.

//
// This file provides some compile-time information about various types.
// These representations were designed, on purpose, to be constant-expressions
// and not types as found in <bits/type_traits.h>.  In particular, they
// can be used in control structures and the optimizer hopefully will do
// the obvious thing.
//
// Why integral expressions, and not functions nor types?
// Firstly, these compile-time entities are used as template-arguments
// so function return values won't work:  We need compile-time entities.
// We're left with types and constant  integral expressions.
// Secondly, from the point of view of ease of use, type-based compile-time
// information is -not- *that* convenient.  On has to write lots of
// overloaded functions and to hope that the compiler will select the right
// one. As a net effect, the overall structure isn't very clear at first
// glance.
// Thirdly, partial ordering and overload resolution (of function templates)
// is highly costly in terms of compiler-resource.  It is a Good Thing to
// keep these resource consumption as least as possible.
//
// See valarray_array.h for a case use.

/* If this file is compiled with threads support, it must
       #define __GTHREADS 1
   to indicate that threads support is present.  Also it has define
   function
     int __gthread_active_p ()
   that returns 1 if thread system is active, 0 if not.

   The threads interface must define the following types:
     __gthread_key_t
     __gthread_once_t
     __gthread_mutex_t
     __gthread_recursive_mutex_t

   The threads interface must define the following macros:

     __GTHREAD_ONCE_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_once_t
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast
		non-recursive mutex.
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast
		non-recursive mutex.
		Define this to a function which looks like this:
		  void __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION (__gthread_mutex_t *)
     		Some systems can't initialize a mutex without a
		function call.  Don't define __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT in this case.
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
     		as above, but for a recursive mutex.

   The threads interface must define the following static functions:

     int __gthread_once (__gthread_once_t *once, void (*func) ())

     int __gthread_key_create (__gthread_key_t *keyp, void (*dtor) (void *))
     int __gthread_key_delete (__gthread_key_t key)

     void *__gthread_getspecific (__gthread_key_t key)
     int __gthread_setspecific (__gthread_key_t key, const void *ptr)

     int __gthread_mutex_destroy (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_destroy (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

     int __gthread_mutex_lock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_mutex_trylock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_mutex_unlock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);

     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_lock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_trylock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_unlock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   The following are supported in POSIX threads only. They are required to
   fix a deadlock in static initialization inside libsupc++. The header file
   gthr-posix.h defines a symbol __GTHREAD_HAS_COND to signify that these extra
   features are supported.

   Types:
     __gthread_cond_t

   Macros:
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT_FUNCTION

   Interface:
     int __gthread_cond_broadcast (__gthread_cond_t *cond);
     int __gthread_cond_wait (__gthread_cond_t *cond, __gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_cond_wait_recursive (__gthread_cond_t *cond,
					__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   All functions returning int should return zero on success or the error
   number.  If the operation is not supported, -1 is returned.

   If the following are also defined, you should
     #define __GTHREADS_CXX0X 1
   to enable the c++0x thread library.

   Types:
     __gthread_t
     __gthread_time_t

   Interface:
     int __gthread_create (__gthread_t *thread, void *(*func) (void*),
                           void *args);
     int __gthread_join (__gthread_t thread, void **value_ptr);
     int __gthread_detach (__gthread_t thread);
     int __gthread_equal (__gthread_t t1, __gthread_t t2);
     __gthread_t __gthread_self (void);
     int __gthread_yield (void);

     int __gthread_mutex_timedlock (__gthread_mutex_t *m,
                                    const __gthread_time_t *abs_timeout);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_timedlock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *m,
                                          const __gthread_time_t *abs_time);

     int __gthread_cond_signal (__gthread_cond_t *cond);
     int __gthread_cond_timedwait (__gthread_cond_t *cond,
                                   __gthread_mutex_t *mutex,
                                   const __gthread_time_t *abs_timeout);

/* Arch-specific definitions.  Each architecture must define the following
   macros to define the expected sizes of pthread data types:

   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_ATTR_T        - size of pthread_attr_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_MUTEX_T       - size of pthread_mutex_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_T   - size of pthread_mutexattr_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_COND_T        - size of pthread_cond_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_CONDATTR_T    - size of pthread_condattr_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_RWLOCK_T      - size of pthread_rwlock_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_T  - size of pthread_rwlockattr_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_BARRIER_T     - size of pthread_barrier_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_BARRIERATTR_T - size of pthread_barrierattr_t.

   Also, the following macros must be define for internal pthread_mutex_t
   struct definitions (struct __pthread_mutex_s):

   __PTHREAD_COMPAT_PADDING_MID   - any additional members after 'kind'
				    and before '__spin' (for 64 bits) or
				    '__nusers' (for 32 bits).
   __PTHREAD_COMPAT_PADDING_END   - any additional members at the end of
				    the internal structure.
   __PTHREAD_MUTEX_LOCK_ELISION   - 1 if the architecture supports lock
				    elision or 0 otherwise.
   __PTHREAD_MUTEX_NUSERS_AFTER_KIND - control where to put __nusers.  The
				       preferred value for new architectures
				       is 0.
   __PTHREAD_MUTEX_USE_UNION      - control whether internal __spins and
				    __list will be place inside a union for
				    linuxthreads compatibility.
				    The preferred value for new architectures
				    is 0.

   For a new port the preferred values for the required defines are:

   #define __PTHREAD_COMPAT_PADDING_MID
   #define __PTHREAD_COMPAT_PADDING_END
   #define __PTHREAD_MUTEX_LOCK_ELISION         0
   #define __PTHREAD_MUTEX_NUSERS_AFTER_KIND    0
   #define __PTHREAD_MUTEX_USE_UNION            0

   __PTHREAD_MUTEX_LOCK_ELISION can be set to 1 if the hardware plans to
   eventually support lock elision using transactional memory.

   The additional macro defines any constraint for the lock alignment
   inside the thread structures:

   __LOCK_ALIGNMENT - for internal lock/futex usage.

   Same idea but for the once locking primitive:

   __ONCE_ALIGNMENT - for pthread_once_t/once_flag definition.

   And finally the internal pthread_rwlock_t (struct __pthread_rwlock_arch_t)
   must be defined.

/* On Solaris 2.6 up to 9, the libc exposes a POSIX threads interface even if
   -pthreads is not specified.  The functions are dummies and most return an
   error value.  However pthread_once returns 0 without invoking the routine
   it is passed so we cannot pretend that the interface is active if -pthreads
   is not specified.  On Solaris 2.5.1, the interface is not exposed at all so
   we need to play the usual game with weak symbols.  On Solaris 10 and up, a
   working interface is always exposed.  On FreeBSD 6 and later, libc also
   exposes a dummy POSIX threads interface, similar to what Solaris 2.6 up
   to 9 does.  FreeBSD >= 700014 even provides a pthread_cancel stub in libc,
   which means the alternate __gthread_active_p below cannot be used there.  */


/* For a program to be multi-threaded the only thing that it certainly must
   be using is pthread_create.  However, there may be other libraries that
   intercept pthread_create with their own definitions to wrap pthreads
   functionality for some purpose.  In those cases, pthread_create being
   defined might not necessarily mean that libpthread is actually linked
   in.

   For the GNU C library, we can use a known internal name.  This is always
   available in the ABI, but no other library would define it.  That is
   ideal, since any public pthread function might be intercepted just as
   pthread_create might be.  __pthread_key_create is an "internal"
   implementation symbol, but it is part of the public exported ABI.  Also,
   it's among the symbols that the static libpthread.a always links in
   whenever pthread_create is used, so there is no danger of a false
   negative result in any statically-linked, multi-threaded program.

   For others, we choose pthread_cancel as a function that seems unlikely
   to be redefined by an interceptor library.  The bionic (Android) C
   library does not provide pthread_cancel, so we do use pthread_create
   there (and interceptor libraries lose).  */

  /** @defgroup functors Function Objects
   * @ingroup utilities
   *
   *  Function objects, or @e functors, are objects with an @c operator()
   *  defined and accessible.  They can be passed as arguments to algorithm
   *  templates and used in place of a function pointer.  Not only is the
   *  resulting expressiveness of the library increased, but the generated
   *  code can be more efficient than what you might write by hand.  When we
   *  refer to @a functors, then, generally we include function pointers in
   *  the description as well.
   *
   *  Often, functors are only created as temporaries passed to algorithm
   *  calls, rather than being created as named variables.
   *
   *  Two examples taken from the standard itself follow.  To perform a
   *  by-element addition of two vectors @c a and @c b containing @c double,
   *  and put the result in @c a, use
   *  \code
   *  transform (a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), a.begin(), plus<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  To negate every element in @c a, use
   *  \code
   *  transform(a.begin(), a.end(), a.begin(), negate<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  The addition and negation functions will be inlined directly.
   *
   *  The standard functors are derived from structs named @c unary_function
   *  and @c binary_function.  These two classes contain nothing but typedefs,
   *  to aid in generic (template) programming.  If you write your own
   *  functors, you might consider doing the same.

  // 20.3.6 binders
  /** @defgroup binders Binder Classes
   * @ingroup functors
   *
   *  Binders turn functions/functors with two arguments into functors
   *  with a single argument, storing an argument to be applied later.
   *  For example, a variable @c B of type @c binder1st is constructed
   *  from a functor @c f and an argument @c x. Later, B's @c
   *  operator() is called with a single argument @c y. The return
   *  value is the value of @c f(x,y). @c B can be @a called with
   *  various arguments (y1, y2, ...) and will in turn call @c
   *  f(x,y1), @c f(x,y2), ...
   *
   *  The function @c bind1st is provided to save some typing. It takes the
   *  function and an argument as parameters, and returns an instance of
   *  @c binder1st.
   *
   *  The type @c binder2nd and its creator function @c bind2nd do the same
   *  thing, but the stored argument is passed as the second parameter instead
   *  of the first, e.g., @c bind2nd(std::minus<float>(),1.3) will create a
   *  functor whose @c operator() accepts a floating-point number, subtracts
   *  1.3 from it, and returns the result. (If @c bind1st had been used,
   *  the functor would perform <em>1.3 - x</em> instead.
   *
   *  Creator-wrapper functions like @c bind1st are intended to be used in
   *  calling algorithms. Their return values will be temporary objects.
   *  (The goal is to not require you to type names like
   *  @c std::binder1st<std::plus<int>> for declaring a variable to hold the
   *  return value from @c bind1st(std::plus<int>(),5).
   *
   *  These become more useful when combined with the composition functions.
   *
   *  These functions are deprecated in C++11 and can be replaced by
   *  @c std::bind (or @c std::tr1::bind) which is more powerful and flexible,
   *  supporting functions with any number of arguments.  Uses of @c bind1st
   *  can be replaced by @c std::bind(f, x, std::placeholders::_1) and
   *  @c bind2nd by @c std::bind(f, std::placeholders::_1, x).

   *  @brief  The actual work of input and output (interface).
   *  @ingroup io
   *
   *  @tparam _CharT  Type of character stream.
   *  @tparam _Traits  Traits for character type, defaults to
   *                   char_traits<_CharT>.
   *
   *  This is a base class.  Derived stream buffers each control a
   *  pair of character sequences:  one for input, and one for output.
   *
   *  Section [27.5.1] of the standard describes the requirements and
   *  behavior of stream buffer classes.  That section (three paragraphs)
   *  is reproduced here, for simplicity and accuracy.
   *
   *  -# Stream buffers can impose various constraints on the sequences
   *     they control.  Some constraints are:
   *     - The controlled input sequence can be not readable.
   *     - The controlled output sequence can be not writable.
   *     - The controlled sequences can be associated with the contents of
   *       other representations for character sequences, such as external
   *       files.
   *     - The controlled sequences can support operations @e directly to or
   *       from associated sequences.
   *     - The controlled sequences can impose limitations on how the
   *       program can read characters from a sequence, write characters to
   *       a sequence, put characters back into an input sequence, or alter
   *       the stream position.
   *     .
   *  -# Each sequence is characterized by three pointers which, if non-null,
   *     all point into the same @c charT array object.  The array object
   *     represents, at any moment, a (sub)sequence of characters from the
   *     sequence.  Operations performed on a sequence alter the values
   *     stored in these pointers, perform reads and writes directly to or
   *     from associated sequences, and alter <em>the stream position</em> and
   *     conversion state as needed to maintain this subsequence relationship.
   *     The three pointers are:
   *     - the <em>beginning pointer</em>, or lowest element address in the
   *       array (called @e xbeg here);
   *     - the <em>next pointer</em>, or next element address that is a
   *       current candidate for reading or writing (called @e xnext here);
   *     - the <em>end pointer</em>, or first element address beyond the
   *       end of the array (called @e xend here).
   *     .
   *  -# The following semantic constraints shall always apply for any set
   *     of three pointers for a sequence, using the pointer names given
   *     immediately above:
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer, then @e xbeg and @e xend shall
   *       also be non-null pointers into the same @c charT array, as
   *       described above; otherwise, @e xbeg and @e xend shall also be null.
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer and @e xnext < @e xend for an
   *       output sequence, then a <em>write position</em> is available.
   *       In this case, @e *xnext shall be assignable as the next element
   *       to write (to put, or to store a character value, into the sequence).
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer and @e xbeg < @e xnext for an
   *       input sequence, then a <em>putback position</em> is available.
   *       In this case, @e xnext[-1] shall have a defined value and is the
   *       next (preceding) element to store a character that is put back
   *       into the input sequence.

/* NOTE: Because of the special way this file is used by <math.h>, this
   file must NOT be protected from multiple inclusion as header files
   usually are.

   This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
   Most functions are declared using the macro:

   __MATHCALL (NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
   `NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
   prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
   `float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
   called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

   Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

   __MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
   instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
   both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.

   Note that there must be no whitespace before the argument passed for
   NAME, to make token pasting work with -traditional.  */

/* NOTE: Because of the special way this file is used by <math.h>, this
   file must NOT be protected from multiple inclusion as header files
   usually are.

   This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
   Most functions are declared using the macro:

   __MATHCALL (NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
   `NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
   prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
   `float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
   called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

   Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

   __MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
   instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
   both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.

   Note that there must be no whitespace before the argument passed for
   NAME, to make token pasting work with -traditional.  */

/* NOTE: Because of the special way this file is used by <math.h>, this
   file must NOT be protected from multiple inclusion as header files
   usually are.

   This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
   Most functions are declared using the macro:

   __MATHCALL (NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
   `NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
   prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
   `float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
   called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

   Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

   __MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
   instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
   both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.

   Note that there must be no whitespace before the argument passed for
   NAME, to make token pasting work with -traditional.  */

/** @file cilk.h
 *
 *  @brief Provides convenient aliases for Intel(R) Cilk(TM) language keywords.
 *
 *  @details
 *  Since Intel Cilk Plus is a nonstandard extension to both C and C++, the Intel
 *  Cilk language keywords all begin with "`_Cilk_`", which guarantees that they
 *  will not conflict with user-defined identifiers in properly written 
 *  programs. This way, a Cilk-enabled C or C++ compiler can safely compile 
 *  "standard" C and C++ programs.
 *
 *  However, this means that the keywords _look_ like something grafted on to
 *  the base language. Therefore, you can include this header:
 *
 *      #include "cilk/cilk.h"
 *
 *  and then write the Intel Cilk keywords with a "`cilk_`" prefix instead of
 *  "`_Cilk_`".

 *
 *  @param param    A string specifying the parameter to be set. One of:
 *  -   `"nworkers"`
 *  -   `"force reduce"`
 *  @param value    A string specifying the parameter value.
 *  @returns        A value from the @ref __cilkrts_set_param_status
 *                  enumeration indicating the result of the operation.
 *
 *  @par The "nworkers" parameter
 *
 *  This parameter specifies the number of worker threads to be created by the
 *  Intel Cilk Plus runtime. @a Value must be a string of digits to be parsed by
 *  `strtol()` as a decimal number.
 *
 *  The number of worker threads is:
 *  1.  the value set with `__cilkrts_set_param("nworkers")`, if it is
 *      positive; otherwise,
 *  2.  the value of the CILK_NWORKERS environment variable, if it is
 *      defined; otherwise
 *  3.  the number of cores available, as reported by the operating system.
 *
 *  @note
 *  Technically, Intel Cilk Plus distinguishes between the _user thread_ (the thread
 *  that the user code was executing on when the Intel Cilk Plus runtime started),
 *  and _worker threads_ (new threads created by the Intel Cilk Plus runtime to
 *  support Intel Cilk Plus parallelism). `nworkers` actually includes both the user
 *  thread and the worker threads; that is, it is one greater than the number of
 *  true "worker threads".
 *
 *  @note
 *  Setting `nworkers = 1` produces serial behavior. Intel Cilk Plus spawns and syncs
 *  will be executed, but with only one worker, continuations will never be
 *  stolen, so all code will execute in serial.
 *
 *  @warning
 *  The number of worker threads can only be set *before* the runtime has
 *  started. Attempting to set it when the runtime is running will have no
 *  effect, and will return an error code. You can call __cilkrts_end_cilk()
 *  to shut down the runtime to change the number of workers.
 *
 *  @warning
 *  The default Intel Cilk scheduler behavior is usually pretty good. The
 *  ability to override `nworkers` can be useful for experimentation, but it
 *  won't usually be necessary for getting good performance.
 *
 *  @par The "force reduce" parameter
 *
 *  This parameter controls whether the runtime should allocate a new view
 *  for a reducer for every parallel strand that it is accessed on. (See
 *  @ref pagereducers.) @a Value must be `"1"` or `"true"` to enable the
 *  "force reduce" behavior, or `"0"` or `"false"` to disable it.
 *
 *  "Force reduce" behavior will also be enabled if
 *  `__cilkrts_set_param("force reduce")` is not called, but the
 *  `CILK_FORCE_REDUCE` environment variable is defined.
 *
 *  @warning
 *  When this option is enabled, `nworkers` should be set to `1`. Using "force
 *  reduce" with more than one worker may result in runtime errors.
 *
 *  @warning
 *  Enabling this option can significantly reduce performance. Use it
 *  _only_ as a debugging tool.

//
// The numeric_limits<> traits document implementation-defined aspects
// of fundamental arithmetic data types (integers and floating points).
// From Standard C++ point of view, there are 14 such types:
//   * integers
//         bool							(1)
//         char, signed char, unsigned char, wchar_t            (4)
//         short, unsigned short				(2)
//         int, unsigned					(2)
//         long, unsigned long					(2)
//
//   * floating points
//         float						(1)
//         double						(1)
//         long double						(1)
//
// GNU C++ understands (where supported by the host C-library)
//   * integer
//         long long, unsigned long long			(2)
//
// which brings us to 16 fundamental arithmetic data types in GNU C++.
//
//
// Since a numeric_limits<> is a bit tricky to get right, we rely on
// an interface composed of macros which should be defined in config/os
// or config/cpu when they differ from the generic (read arbitrary)
// definitions given here.
//

// These values can be overridden in the target configuration file.
// The default values are appropriate for many 32-bit targets.

// GCC only intrinsically supports modulo integral types.  The only remaining
// integral exceptional values is division by zero.  Only targets that do not
// signal division by zero in some "hard to ignore" way should use false.

// float
//

// Default values.  Should be overridden in configuration files if necessary.


// double

// Default values.  Should be overridden in configuration files if necessary.


// long double

// Default values.  Should be overridden in configuration files if necessary.


// You should not need to define any macros below this point.





// The fraction 643/2136 approximates log10(2) to 7 significant digits.

 *  @note       Just to repeat: if `F` is an empty class, then

 *
 *  The code above is problematic because the evaluation of the T2

 *  `provisional_guard` constructor (and with respect the T1 constructor).

/** Wrapper class for move-in construction.
 *
 *  Some types allow their values to be _moved_ as an alternative to copying.
 *  Moving a value may be much faster than copying it, but may leave the value
 *  of the move's source undefined. Consider the `swap` operation provided by
 *  many STL container classes:
 *
 *      list<T> x, y;
 *      x = y;      // Copy
 *      x.swap(y);  // Move
 *
 *  The assignment _copies_ the value of `y` into `x` in time linear in the
 *  size of `y`, leaving `y` unchanged. The `swap` _moves_ the  value of `y`
 *  into `x` in constant time, but it also moves the value of `x` into `y`,
 *  potentially leaving `y` undefined.
 *
 *  A move_in_wrapper simply wraps a pointer to an object. It is created by a
 *  call to cilk::move_in(). Passing a move_in_wrapper to a view constructor
 *  (actually, passing it to a reducer constructor, which passes it to the
 *  monoid `construct()` function, which passes it to the view constructor)
 *  allows, but does not require, the value pointed to by the wrapper to be
 *  moved into the view instead of copied.
 *
 *  A view class exercises this option by defining a _move-in constructor_,
 *  i.e., a constructor with a move_in_wrapper parameter. The constructor calls
 *  the wrapper's `value()` function to get a reference to its pointed-to
 *  value, and can then use that reference in a move operation.
 *
 *  A move_in_wrapper also has an implicit conversion to its pointed-to value,
 *  so if a view class does not define a move-in constructor, its ordinary
 *  value constructor will be called with the wrapped value. For example, an
 *  @ref ReducersAdd "op_add" view does not have a move-in constructor, so
 *
 *      int x;
 *      reducer< op_add<int> > xr(move_in(x));
 *
 *  will simply call the `op_add_view(const int &)` constructor. But an
 *  @ref ReducersList "op_list_append" view does have a move-in  constructor,
 *  so
 *
 *      list<int> x;
 *      reducer< op_list_append<int> > xr(move_in(x));
 *
 *  will call the `op_list_append_view(move_in_wrapper<int>)` constructor,
 *  which can `swap` the value of `x` into the view.
 *
 *  @note   Remember that passing the value of a variable to a reducer
 *          constructor using a move_in_wrapper leaves the variable undefined.
 *          You cannot assume that the constructor either will or will not copy
 *          or move the value.

/** Wrapper class to allow implicit downcasts to reducer subclasses.
 *
 *  The Intel Cilk Plus library contains a collection of reducer wrapper classes which
 *  were created before the `cilk::reducer<Monoid>` style was developed. For
 *  example, `cilk::reducer_opadd<Type>` provided essentially the same
 *  functionality that is now provided by
 *  `cilk::reducer< cilk::op_add<Type> >`. These legacy reducer classes are
 *  deprecated, but still supported, and they have been reimplemented as
 *  subclasses of the corresponding `cilk::reducer` classes. For example:
 *
 *      template <class T>
 *      reducer_opadd<T> : public reducer< op_add<T> > { ... };
 *
 *  This reimplementation allows transparent conversion between legacy and
 *  new reducers. That is, a `reducer<op_add>*` or `reducer<op_add>&` can be
 *  used anywhere that a `reducer_opadd*` or `reducer_opadd&` is expected,
 *  and vice versa.
 *
 *  The conversion from the legacy reducer to the new reducer is just an
 *  up-cast, which is provided for free by C++. The conversion from the new
 *  reducer to the legacy reducer is a down-cast, though, which requires an
 *  explicit conversion member function in the `reducer` class. The challenge
 *  is to define a function in the reducer template class which will convert
 *  each cilk::reducer specialization to the corresponding legacy reducer,
 *  if there is one.
 *
 *  The trick is in the legacy_reducer_downcast template class, which provides
 *  a mapping from  `cilk::reducer` specializations to legacy reducer classes.
 *  `reducer<Monoid>` has a conversion function to convert itself to
 *  `legacy_reducer_downcast< reducer<Monoid> >::%type`. By default,
 *  `legacy_reducer_downcast<Reducer>::%type` is just a trivial subclass of
 *  `Reducer`, which is uninteresting, but a reducer with a legacy counterpart
 *  will have a specialization of `legacy_reducer_downcast` whose `type` is
 *  the corresponding legacy reducer. For example:
 *
 *      template <typename Type>
 *      struct legacy_reducer_downcast< reducer< op_add<Type> > >
 *      {
 *          typedef reducer_opadd<Type> type;
 *      };
 *
 *
 *  @tparam Reducer The new-style reducer class whose corresponding legacy
 *                  reducer class is `type`, if there is such a legacy reducer
 *                  class.

     *
     *  This Reducer class instantiation specifies cache-line alignment of the
     *  leftmost view field (and, implicitly, of the reducer itself). You got
     *  this assertion because a reducer with this class was allocated at a
     *  non-cache-aligned address, probably because it was allocated on the
     *  heap with `new`. This can be a problem for two reasons:
     *
     *  1.  If the leftmost view is not on a cache line by itself, there might
     *      be a slowdown resulting from accesses to the same cache line from
     *      different threads.
     *
     *  2.  The compiler thinks that reducer is cache-line aligned, but it
     *      really isn't. If the reducer is contained in a structure, then the
     *      compiler will believe that the containing structure, and other
     *      fields contained in it, are also more aligned than they really
     *      are. In particular, if the structure contains a numeric array that
     *      is used in a vectorizable loop, then the compiler might generate
     *      invalid vector instructions, resulting in a runtime error.
     *
     *  The compiler will always allocate reducer variables, and structure
     *  variables containing reducers, with their required alignment.
     *  Reducers, and structures containing a reducer, which are allocated
     *  on the heap with `new` will _not_ be properly aligned.
     *
     *  There are three ways that you can fix this assertion failure.
     *
     *  A.  Rewrite your code to use the new-style `reducer< op_XXX<Type> >`
     *      instead of the legacy `reducer_XXX<type>`. The new-style reducers
     *      are not declared to be cache-aligned, and will work properly if
     *      they are not cache-aligned.
     *
     *  B.  If you must allocate an old-style reducer or a structure containing
     *      a reducer on the heap, figure out how to align it correctly. The
     *      suggested fix is to use `cilk::aligned_new()` and
     *      `cilk::aligned_delete()` instead of `new` and `delete`, as follows:
     *
     *          Type* ptr = cilk::aligned_new<Type>(constructor-arguments);
     *          cilk::aligned_delete(ptr);
     *
     *  C.  Define the macro CILK_IGNORE_REDUCER_ALIGNMENT, which will suppress
     *      the assertion check. Do this only if you are comfortable that
     *      problem (2) above will not occur.

     *      -   You can assume that move_in() will be at least as efficient as

     *          you need the value of @a obj to be unchanged after the call.

     *  @note   In particular, when @a Type is a container type with a

     *
     *  This function is used to retrieve the final value of the reducer's
     *  accumulator variable by either copying or _moving_ the value of @a obj
     *  into it. Moving a value can often be performed in constant time, even

     *  value of the reducer's accumulator variable undefined. (See the

     *
     *  @par    Usage
     *          A move_in() call to initialize a reducer is often paired with a
     *          move_out() call to get its final value:
     *

     *              xr.move_in(x);
     *              … do the reduction …
     *              xr.move_out(x);
     *
     *  @par Assumptions
     *      -   You cannot assume either that this will function will copy its
     *          value or that it will move it.
     *      -   You must assume that the value of the reducer's accumulator
     *          variable will be undefined after the call to move_out().
     *      -   You can assume that move_out() will be at least as efficient as
     *          get_value(), and you should therefore prefer move_out() unless
     *          you need the accumulator variable to be preserved after the
     *          call.
     *
     *  @warning    Calling this function other than to retrieve the final

/** @page page_reducers_in_c Creating and Using Reducers in C
 *
 *  @tableofcontents
 *
 *  The Intel Cilk Plus runtime supports reducers written in C as well as in C++. The
 *  basic logic is the same, but the implementation details are very
 *  different. The C++ reducer implementation uses templates heavily to create
 *  very generic components. The C reducer implementation uses macros, which
 *  are a much blunter instrument. The most immediate consequence is that the
 *  monoid/view/reducer architecture is mostly implicit rather than explicit
 *  in C reducers.
 *
 *  @section reducers_c_overview Overview of Using Reducers in C
 *
 *  The basic usage pattern for C reducers is:
 *
 *  1.  Create and initialize a reducer object.
 *  2.  Tell the Intel Cilk Plus runtime about the reducer.
 *  3.  Update the value contained in the reducer in a parallel computation.
 *  4.  Tell the Intel Cilk Plus runtime that you are done with the reducer.
 *  5.  Retrieve the value from the reducer.
 *
 *  @subsection reducers_c_creation Creating and Initializing a C Reducer
 *
 *  The basic pattern for creating and initializing a reducer object in C is
 *
 *      CILK_C_DECLARE_REDUCER(value-type) reducer-name =
 *          CILK_C_INIT_REDUCER(value-type,
 *                              reduce-function,
 *                              identity-function,
 *                              destroy-function,
 *                              initial-value);
 *
 *  This is simply an initialized definition of a variable named
 *  _reducer-name_. The @ref CILK_C_DECLARE_REDUCER macro expands to an
 *  anonymous `struct` declaration for a reducer object containing a view of
 *  type _value-type_, and the @ref CILK_C_INIT_REDUCER macro expands to a
 *  struct initializer.
 *
 *  @subsection reducers_c_reduce_func Reduce Functions
 *
 *  The reduce function for a reducer is called when a parallel execution
 *  strand terminates, to combine the values computed by the terminating
 *  strand and the strand to its left. It takes three arguments:
 *
 *  -   `void* reducer` - the address of the reducer.
 *  -   `void* left` - the address of the value for the left strand.
 *  -   `void* right` - the address of the value for the right (terminating)
 *                      strand.
 *
 *  It must apply the reducer's reduction operation to the `left` and `right`
 *  values, leaving the result in the `left` value. The `right` value is
 *  undefined after the reduce function call.
 *
 *  @subsection reducers_c_identity_func Identity Functions
 *
 *  The identity function for a reducer is called when a parallel execution
 *  strand begins, to initialize its value to the reducer's identity value. It
 *  takes two arguments:
 *
 *  -   `void* reducer` - the address of the reducer.
 *  -   `void* v` - the address of a freshly allocated block of memory of size
 *      `sizeof(value-type)`.
 *
 *  It must initialize the memory pointed to by `v` so that it contains the
 *  reducer's identity value.
 *
 *  @subsection reducers_c_destroy_func Destroy Functions
 *
 *  The destroy function for a reducer is called when a parallel execution
 *  strand terminates, to do any necessary cleanup before its value is
 *  deallocated. It takes two arguments:
 *
 *  -   `void* reducer` - the address of the reducer.
 *  -   `void* p` - the address of the value for the terminating strand.
 *
 *  It must release any resources belonging to the value pointed to by `p`, to
 *  avoid a resource leak when the memory containing the value is deallocated.
 *
 *  The runtime function `__cilkrts_hyperobject_noop_destroy` can be used for
 *  the destructor function if the reducer's values do not need any cleanup.
 *
 *  @subsection reducers_c_register Tell the Intel Cilk Plus Runtime About the
 *  Reducer
 *
 *  Call the @ref CILK_C_REGISTER_REDUCER macro to register the reducer with
 *  the Intel Cilk Plus runtime:
 *
 *      CILK_C_REGISTER_REDUCER(reducer-name);
 *
 *  The runtime will manage reducer values for all registered reducers when
 *  parallel execution strands begin and end.
 *
 *  @subsection reducers_c_update Update the Value Contained in the Reducer
 *
 *  The @ref REDUCER_VIEW macro returns a reference to the reducer's value for
 *  the current parallel strand:
 *
 *      REDUCER_VIEW(reducer-name) = REDUCER_VIEW(reducer-name) OP x;
 *
 *  C++ reducer views restrict access to the wrapped value so that it can only
 *  be modified in ways consistent with the reducer's operation. No such
 *  protection is provided for C reducers.  It is entirely the responsibility
 *  of the user to avoid modifying the value in any inappropriate way.
 *
 *  @subsection c_reducers_unregister Tell the Intel Cilk Plus Runtime That You Are
 *  Done with the Reducer
 *
 *  When the parallel computation is complete, call the @ref
 *  CILK_C_UNREGISTER_REDUCER macro to unregister the reducer with the
 *  Intel Cilk Plus runtime:
 *
 *      CILK_C_UNREGISTER_REDUCER(reducer-name);
 *
 *  The runtime will stop managing reducer values for the reducer.
 *
 *  @subsection c_reducers_retrieve Retrieve the Value from the Reducer
 *
 *  When the parallel computation is complete, use the @ref REDUCER_VIEW macro
 *  to retrieve the final value computed by the reducer.
 *
 *  @subsection reducers_c_example_custom Example - Creating and Using a
 *              Custom C Reducer

 *      void IntList_append(IntList* list, int x)
 *      {
 *          IntListNode* node = (IntListNode*) malloc(sizeof(IntListNode));
 *          if (list->tail) list->tail->next = node; else list->head = node;
 *          list->tail = node;
 *      }
 *
 *      // Append the right list to the left list, and leave the right list
 *      // empty
 *      void IntList_concat(IntList* left, IntList* right)
 *      {
 *          if (left->head) {
 *              left->tail->next = right->head;
 *              if (right->tail) left->tail = right->tail;

 *          }
 *          IntList_init(*right);

 *
 *  @section reducers_c_predefined Predefined C Reducers
 *
 *  Some of the predefined reducer classes in the Intel Cilk Plus library come with
 *  a set of predefined macros to provide the same capabilities in C.
 *  In general, two macros are provided for each predefined reducer family:
 *
 *  -   `CILK_C_REDUCER_operation(reducer-name, type-name, initial-value)` -
 *      Declares a reducer object named _reducer-name_ with initial value
 *      _initial-value_ to perform a reduction using the _operation_ on values
 *      of the type specified by _type-name_.  This is the equivalent of the
 *      general code described in @ref reducers_c_creation :
 *
 *          CILK_C_DECLARE_REDUCER(type) reducer-name =
 *              CILK_C_INIT_REDUCER(type, ..., initial-value);
 *
 *      where _type_ is the C type corresponding to _type_name_. See @ref
 *      reducers_c_type_names below for the _type-names_ that you can use.
 *
 *  -   `CILK_C_REDUCER_operation_TYPE(type-name)` - Expands to the `typedef`
 *      name for the type of the reducer object declared by
 *      `CILK_C_REDUCER_operation(reducer-name, type-name, initial-value)`.
 *
 *  See @ref reducers_c_example_predefined.
 *
 *  The predefined C reducers are:
 *
 *  |   Operation       |   Name        |   Documentation               |
 *  |-------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
 *  |   addition        |   `OPADD`     |   @ref ReducersAdd            |

 *
 *  @subsection reducers_c_type_names Numeric Type Names
 *
 *  The type and function names created by the C reducer definition macros
 *  incorporate both the reducer kind (`opadd`, `opxor`, etc.) and the value
 *  type of the reducer (`int`, `double`, etc.). The value type is represented
 *  by a _numeric type name_ string. The types supported in C reducers, and
 *  their corresponding numeric type names, are given in the following table:
 *
 *  |   Type                |   Numeric Type Name           |
 *  |-----------------------|-------------------------------|
 *  |  `char`               |  `char`                       |

/** @defgroup ReducersAdd Addition Reducers
 *
 *  Addition reducers allow the computation of the sum of a set of values in
 *  parallel.
 *
 *  @ingroup Reducers
 *
 *  You should be familiar with @ref pagereducers "Intel(R) Cilk(TM) Plus reducers",
 *  described in file `reducers.md`, and particularly with @ref reducers_using,
 *  before trying to use the information in this file.
 *
 *  @section redopadd_usage Usage Example
 *
 *      cilk::reducer< cilk::op_add<int> > r;
 *      cilk_for (int i = 0; i != N; ++i) {
 *          *r += a[i];
 *      }
 *      return r.get_value();
 *
 *  @section redopadd_monoid The Monoid
 *
 *  @subsection redopadd_monoid_values Value Set
 *
 *  The value set of an addition reducer is the set of values of `Type`, which
 *  is expected to be a builtin numeric type (or something like it, such as
 *  `std::complex`).
 *
 *  @subsection redopadd_monoid_operator Operator
 *
 *  The operator of an addition reducer is the addition operator, defined by
 *  the "`+`" binary operator on `Type`.
 *
 *  @subsection redopadd_monoid_identity Identity
 *
 *  The identity value of the reducer is the numeric value "`0`". This is
 *  expected to be the value of the default constructor `Type()`.
 *
 *  @section redopadd_operations Operations
 *
 *  @subsection redopadd_constructors Constructors
 *
 *      reducer()   // identity
 *      reducer(const Type& value)
 *      reducer(move_in(Type& variable))
 *
 *  @subsection redopadd_get_set Set and Get
 *
 *      r.set_value(const Type& value)
 *      const Type& = r.get_value() const
 *      r.move_in(Type& variable)
 *      r.move_out(Type& variable)
 *
 *  @subsection redopadd_initial Initial Values
 *
 *  If an addition reducer is constructed without an explicit initial value,
 *  then its initial value will be its identity value, as long as `Type`
 *  satisfies the requirements of @ref redopadd_types.
 *
 *  @subsection redopadd_view_ops View Operations
 *
 *      *r += a
 *      *r -= a
 *      ++*r
 *      --*r
 *      (*r)++
 *      (*r)--
 *      *r = *r + a
 *      *r = *r - a
 *      *r = *r ± a1 ± a2 … ± an
 *
 *  The post-increment and post-decrement operations do not return a value. (If
 *  they did, they would expose the value contained in the view, which is
 *  non-deterministic in the middle of a reduction.)
 *
 *  Note that subtraction operations are allowed on an addition reducer because
 *  subtraction is equivalent to addition with a negated operand. It is true
 *  that `(x - y) - z` is not equivalent to `x - (y - z)`, but
 *  `(x + (-y)) + (-z)` _is_ equivalent to `x + ((-y) + (-z))`.
 *
 *  @section redopadd_floating_point Issues with Floating-Point Types
 *
 *  Because of precision and round-off issues, floating-point addition is not
 *  really associative. For example, `(1e30 + -1e30) + 1 == 1`, but
 *  `1e30 + (-1e30 + 1) == 0`.
 *
 *  In many cases, this won't matter, but computations which have been
 *  carefully ordered to control round-off errors may not deal well with
 *  being reassociated. In general, you should be sure to understand the
 *  floating-point behavior of your program before doing any transformation
 *  that will reassociate its computations.
 *
 *  @section redopadd_types Type and Operator Requirements
 *
 *  `Type` must be `Copy Constructible`, `Default Constructible`, and
 *  `Assignable`.
 *
 *  The operator "`+=`" must be defined on `Type`, with `x += a` having the
 *  same meaning as `x = x + a`. In addition, if the code uses the "`-=`",
 *  pre-increment, post-increment, pre-decrement, or post-decrement operators,
 *  then the corresponding operators must be defined on `Type`.
 *
 *  The expression `Type()` must be a valid expression which yields the
 *  identity value (the value of `Type` whose numeric value is zero).
 *
 *  @section redopadd_in_c Addition Reducers in C
 *
 *  The @ref CILK_C_REDUCER_OPADD and @ref CILK_C_REDUCER_OPADD_TYPE macros can
 *  be used to do addition reductions in C. For example:
 *
 *      CILK_C_REDUCER_OPADD(r, double, 0);
 *      CILK_C_REGISTER_REDUCER(r);
 *      cilk_for(int i = 0; i != n; ++i) {
 *          REDUCER_VIEW(r) += a[i];
 *      }
 *      CILK_C_UNREGISTER_REDUCER(r);
 *      printf("The sum of the elements of a is %f\n", REDUCER_VIEW(r));
 *
 *  See @ref reducers_c_predefined.

/* C++ Interface
 *
 * Classes: holder<Type>
 *
 * Description:
 * ============
 * This component provides a hyperobject that isolates a parallel uses of a
 * common variable where it is not necessary to preserve changes from
 * different parallel strands.  In effect, a holder acts a bit like
 * thread-local storage, but has qualities that work better with the
 * fork-join structure of Intel(R) Cilk(TM) Plus.  In particular, a holder has the
 * following qualities:
 *
 * - The view of a holder before the first spawn within a function is the same
 *   as the view after each sync (as in the case of a reducer).
 * - The view of a holder within the first spawned child of a function (or the
 *   first child spawned after a sync) is the same as the view on entry to the
 *   function.
 * - The view of a holder before entering a _Cilk_for loop is the same as the
 *   view during the first iteration of the loop and the view at the end of
 *   the loop.
 * - The view of a holder in the continuation of a spawn or in an arbitrary
 *   iteration of a _Cilk_for loop is *non-deterministic*.  It is generally
 *   recommended that the holder be explicitly put into a known state in these
 *   situations.
 *
 * A holder can be used as an alternative to parameter-passing.  They are most
 * useful for replacing non-local variables without massive refactoring.  A
 * holder takes advantage of the fact that, most of the time, a holder view
 * does not change after a spawn or from one iteration of a parallel for loop
 * to the next (i.e., stealing is the exception, not the rule).  When the
 * holder view is a large object that is expensive to construct, this
 * optimization can save significant time versus creating a separate local
 * object for each view.  In addition, a holder using the "keep last" policy
 * will have the same value after a sync as the serialization of the same
 * program.  The last quality will often allow the program to avoid
 * recomputing a value.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ==============
 * Function 'compute()' is a complex function that computes a value using a
 * memoized algorithm, storing intermediate results in a hash table.  Compute
 * calls several other functions, each of which calls several other functions,
 * all of which share a global hash table.  In all, there are over a dozen
 * functions with a total of about 60 references to the hash table.  
 *..
 *  hash_table<int, X> memos;
 *
 *  void h(const X& x);  // Uses memos
 *
 *  double compute(const X& x)
 *  {
 *     memos.clear();
 *     // ...
 *     memos[i] = x;
 *     ...
 *     g(i);  // Uses memos
 *     // ...
 *     std::for_each(c.begin(), c.end(), h);  // Call h for each element of c
 *  }
 *
 *  int main()
 *  {
 *      const std::size_t ARRAY_SIZE = 1000000;
 *      extern X myArray[ARRAY_SIZE];
 *
 *      for (std::size_t i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; ++i)
 *      {
 *          compute(myArray[i]);
 *      }
 *  }
 *..
 * We would like to replace the 'for' loop in 'main' with a 'cilk_for'.
 * Although the hash table is cleared on entry to each call to 'compute()',
 * and although the values stored in the hash table are no longer used after
 * 'compute()' returns, the use of the hash table as a global variable
 * prevents 'compute()' from being called safely in parallel.  One way to do
 * this would be to make 'memos' a private variable within the cilk_for loop
 * and pass it down to the actual computation, so that each loop iteration has
 * its own private copy:
 *..
 *      cilk_for (std::size_t i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; ++i)
 *      {
 *          hash_table<int, X> memos;
 *          compute(myArray[i], memos);
 *      }
 *..
 * The problem with this approach is that it requires changing the signature
 * of 'compute', 'h', 'g', and every one of the dozen or so functions that
 * reference 'memos' as well as any function that calls those functions.  This
 * may break the abstraction of 'compute' and other functions, exposing an
 * implementation detail that was not part of the interface.  In addition, the
 * function 'h' is called through a templated algorithm, 'for_each', which
 * requires a fixed interface.  Finally, there is constructor and destructor
 * overhead for 'hash_table' each time through the loop.
 *
 * The alternative approach is to replace 'memos' with a holder.  The holder
 * would be available to all of the functions involved, but would not cause a
 * race between parallel loop iterations.  In order to make this work, each
 * use of the 'memos' variable must be (mechanically) replaced by a use of the
 * holder:
 *..
 *  cilk::holder<hash_table<int, X> > memos_h;
 *
 *  void h(const X& x);  // Uses memos_h
 *
 *  double compute(const X& x)
 *  {
 *     memos_h().clear();  // operator() used to "dereference" the holder
 *     // ...
 *     memos_h()[i] = x;   // operator() used to "dereference" the holder
 *     ...
 *     g(i);  // Uses memos_h
 *     // ...
 *     std::for_each(c.begin(), c.end(), h);  // Call h for each element of c
 *  }
 *..
 * Note that each reference to the holder must be modified with an empty pair
 * of parenthesis.  This syntax is needed because there is no facility in C++
 * for a "smart reference" that would allow 'memos_h' to be a perfect
 * replacement for 'memos'.  One way that a user can avoid this syntax change
 * is to wrap the holder in a class that has the same inteface as
 * 'hash_table' but redirects all calls to the holder:
 *..
 *  template <typename K, typename V>
 *  class hash_table_holder
 *  {
 *    private:
 *      cilk::holder<hash_table<K, V> > m_holder;
 *    public:
 *      void clear() { m_holder().clear(); }
 *      V& operator[](const K& x) { return m_holder()[x]; }
 *      std::size_t size() const { return m_holder().size(); }
 *      // etc. ...
 *  };
 *..
 * Using the above wrapper, the original code can be left unchanged except for
 * replacing 'hash_table' with 'hash_table_holder' and replacing 'for' with
 * 'cilk_for':
 *..
 *  hash_table_holder<int, X> memos;
 *
 *  void h(const X& x);  // Uses memos
 *
 *  double compute(const X& x)
 *  {
 *     memos.clear();  // Calls hash_table_holder::clear().
 *     // ...
 *  }
 *..
 * The above changes have no benefit over the use of thread-local storage.
 * What if one of the functions has a 'cilk_spawn', however?
 *..
 *  void h(const X& x)
 *  {
 *      Y y = x.nested();
 *      double d, w;
 *      if (y)
 *      {
 *          w = cilk_spawn compute_width(y); // May use 'memos'
 *          d = compute_depth(y);            // Does not use 'memos'
 *          cilk_sync;
 *          compute(y);  // recursive call.  Uses 'memos'.
 *      }
 *  }
 *..
 * In the above example, the view of the holder within 'compute_width' is the
 * same as the view on entry to 'h'.  More importantly, the view of the holder
 * within the recursive call to 'compute' is the same as the view on entry to
 * 'h', even if a different worker is executing the recursive call.  Thus, the
 * holder view within a Intel Cilk Plus program has useful qualities not found in
 * thread-local storage.

     * value stored into the holder by one of the starnds entering the sync.
     * The holder policy used to instantiate the holder determines which of
     * the entering strands determines the final value of the holder. A policy
     * of 'holder_keep_indeterminate' (the default) is the most efficient, and
     * results in an indeterminate value depending on the runtime schedule
     * (see below for more specifics).  An indeterminate value after a sync is
     * often acceptable, especially if the value of the holder is not reused
     * after the sync.  All of the remaining policies retain the value of the
     * last strand that would be executed in the serialization of the program.
     * They differ in the mechanism used to move the value from one view to
     * another.  A policy of 'holder_keep_last_copy' moves values by
     * copy-assignment.  A policy of 'holder_keep_last_swap' moves values by
     * calling 'swap'.  A policy of 'holder_keep_last_move' is available only
     * for compilers that support C++0x rvalue references and moves values by
     * move-assignment.  A policy of 'holder_keep_last' attempts to choose the
     * most efficient mechanism: member-function 'swap' if the view type
     * supports it, otherwise move-assignment if supported, otherwise
     * copy-assignment.  (The swap member function for a class that provides
     * one is almost always as fast or faster than move-assignment or
     * copy-assignment.)
     *
     * The behavior of 'holder_keep_indeterminate', while indeterminate, is
     * not random and can be used for advanced programming or debugging.  With
     * a policy of 'holder_keep_intermediate', values are never copied or
     * moved between views.  The value of the view after a sync is the same as
     * the value set in the last spawned child before a steal occurs or the
     * last value set in the continuation if no steal occurs.  Using this
     * knowledge, a programmer can use a holder to detect the earliest steal
     * in a piece of code.  An indeterminate holder is also useful for keeping
     * cached data similar to the way some applications might use thread-local
     * storage.
